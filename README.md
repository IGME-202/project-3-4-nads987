# Project Documentation

-   Name: NADYA SOTO
-   Section: 06
-   Assignment: HUMANS V ZOMBIES

**PLEASE REPLACE THE TEXT IN EACH SECTION WITH YOUR OWN DOCUMENTATION**

## Description
Humans and zombies are contained within the platform. Zombies are able to seek out humans while Humans flee when the zombies are near. If a human is caught, the human will turn into a zombie.


## User Responsibilities
Debug lines can be turned off with the space key.(in progress)

## Above and Beyond <kbd>OPTIONAL</kbd>

What did you add or do in your program to earn above and beyond **bouns** points?

-   Be specific and explicit!
-   We are not mind readers.

Bouns points for above and beyond will only be earned if it is listed in this file.

## Known Issues

There are problems with the game objects getting stuck into the corner, also the debug lines are drawn pretty weird, they point to the origin. There were some test runs where the last human didn't get turned into a zombie. Also, there is an index problem once all humans are zombified, which would be solved with a game over that will be implemented in proj 4.

## Requirements not completed

If you did not complete a project requirement, notate that here
I was having trouble toggling the debug lines, will fix soon.Was unsure because the method isn't called.
