# Project Documentation

-   Name: NADYA SOTO
-   Section: 06
-   Assignment: HUMANS V ZOMBIES

**PLEASE REPLACE THE TEXT IN EACH SECTION WITH YOUR OWN DOCUMENTATION**

## Description
Humans and zombies are contained within the platform. Zombies are able to seek out humans while Humans flee when the zombies are near. If a human is caught, the human will turn into a zombie. Once all humans are caught, the zombies will wander around the platform.


## User Responsibilities
Use the buttonb to generate more zombies and/or humans.

## Above and Beyond <kbd>OPTIONAL</kbd>
I added buttons to add more zombies and humans using the Canvas and on click events.

## Known Issues

Sometimes, the script will give "transform position attempt is invalid" randomly, and will keep the gameObject in place. I also had a problem with having LookRotation and having
the gameObjects upright. So, Look Rotation line is commented out. I don't think the Seperation properly works. Sometimes, the gameObjects will come off the platform.
